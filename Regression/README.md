### Some regression problems I'll be working on this summer

1. Priedict tomorrowâ€™s stock market price given current market conditions and other possible side information.
2. Predict the age of a viewer watching a given video on YouTube.
3. Predict the location in 3d space of a robot arm end effector, given control signals (torques) sent to its various motors.
4. Predict the amount of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the body as a function of a numberof different clinical measurements.
5. Predict the temperature at any location inside a building using weather data, time, door sensors, etc.
