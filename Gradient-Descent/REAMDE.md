### Types of Gradient Descent algorithms:

* On the basis of data ingestion
 1. Full Batch Gradient Descent Algorithm - we use whole data at once to compute the gradient
 2. Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm - we take a sample while computing the gradient
* On the basis of differentiation techniques
 1. First order Differentiation - Uses first order differentiation to calculate calculate cost function
 2. Second Order Differentiation - Uses second order differentiation to calculate calculate cost function

* Variants of Gradient Descent
 1. Vanilla Gradient Descent
 2. Gradient Descent with momentum
 3.
